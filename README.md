# serial_router_python_arduino
A Serial connection providing system between arduino and python app on com3 port

-arduino used in this Project is an UNO R3 clon.
-data transferred via COM3 port. If this is different, port textbox does nothing. sorry about that. you need to configure it yourself in the python code. but wait for future updates!
-after uploading .ino file to your arduino of choice, you must shut the arduino ide down. At least close the serial panel.
